.SH DESCRIPTION
This manual page documents briefly the
.B quake2
command.
.PP
\fBQuake II\fP is a popular first-person shooter game, released in 1997
by iD Software.  This wrapper script will launch the Quake II engine.  The
game data needs to be installed independently using the 'game-data-packager'
program, and by default it will be looked for at \fI/usr/share/games/quake2\fR
and \fI/usr/share/games/quake2-demo\fR.
.PP
This wrapper script accepts a few GNU-style options.
Any further arguments are passed to the engine unmodified.
Consult the engine documentation for full details, but most engines support a
syntax where you can give console commands by prefixing with a plus sign.
.SH OPTIONS
These options are accepted for \fBWRAPPER-OPTIONS\fR in the
synopsis.
.TP
.B \-h, \-\-help
Show summary of options.
.TP
.B \-v, \-\-version
Show version of program.
.TP
.B \-\-engine=\fBENGINE\fR

.TP
.B \-\-demo

installed
.SH EXAMPLES
