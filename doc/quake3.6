.SH NAME
quake3 \- Quake III Arena client

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B quake3
.BR "" [ \-h | \-\-help ]
.BR "" [ \-q | \-\-quiet ]
.BR "" [ +set
.IR option " " value ]...

.SH DESCRIPTION
.B quake3
is the client for Quake III Arena, a multiplayer network game.

.SH OPTIONS
The wrapper script used for Quake III Arena in Debian accepts these options:
.TP
\fB\-h\fR, \fB\-\-help\fR
Display a short help summary
.TP
\fB\-q\fR, \fB\-\-quiet\fR
Disable all console output
.TP
\fB\-\-demo\fR
Run the demo version, even if the full game is installed
.PP
Additionally, if \fBquake3\fR is run via a symbolic link whose name
contains \fBteam-arena\fR or \fBteamarena\fR, it will play the expansion pack,
\fBQuake III Team Arena\fR. This requires that additional data files are
installed. Similarly, a symbolic link containing \fBdemo\fR is equivalent
to the \fB\-\-demo\fR option.
.PP
Any console command can also be prefixed with \fB+\fR and used as a
command-line option (press Shift+Esc to access the in-game console), including:
.TP
\fB+set\fR \fIoption\fR \fIvalue\fR
Set an option (see below for some options)
.TP
\fB+connect\fR \fIserver\fR[\fB:\fIport\fR]
Connect to a server
