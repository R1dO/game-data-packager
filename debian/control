Description: Installer for game data files
 Various games are divided into two logical parts: engine
 and data. Often the engine and data are licensed in
 different ways, such that only one half can be distributed
 in Debian.
 .
 game-data-packager is a tool which builds .deb files for game
 data which cannot be distributed in Debian (such as
 commercial game data).
 .
 At the moment, game-data-packager has support for building .deb
 files for:
 .
  * Chex Quest and Chex Quest 2
  * The Curse of Monkey Island
  * Day of the Tentacle
  * Descent and Descent II
  * Doom, Doom II, Final Doom, Doom III and Doom III BFG Edition
  * Full Throttle
  * Grim Fandango
  * HacX
  * Heretic, Hexen and Hexen II
  * LGeneral (Panzer General)
  * Maniac Mansion
  * Quake, Quake II and Quake III Arena
  * Rise of the Triad
  * Star Wars Jedi Knight II: Jedi Outcast and Jedi Academy
  * Strife
  * Syndicate
  * Theme Hospital
  * Tyrian
  * Wolfenstein 3D, Spear of Destiny and Return to Castle Wolfenstein
