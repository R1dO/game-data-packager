Description: Installer for game data files
 Various games are divided into two logical parts: engine
 and data. Often the engine and data are licensed in
 different ways, such that the engine can be distributed
 in Debian but the data cannot.
 .
 game-data-packager is a tool which builds .deb files for game
 data which cannot be distributed in Debian (such as
 commercial game data).
 .
 At the moment, game-data-packager has support for building .deb
 files for:
 .

Description: science-fiction-themed multiplayer first person shooter
 Enemy Territory: Quake Wars is a multiplayer first-person shooter game
 by Splash Damage and id Software, released in 2007.
 This package contains a launcher script and menu entry to play
 ETQW using the proprietary x86 binaries provided by id Software.
 .
 Please note that the ETQW engine is not Free Software, and Debian
 cannot fix any bugs or security flaws in the engine or game code.
 .
 To make this package useful, you will need to create and install some
 non-distributable packages by using the game-data-packager package:
 etqw-bin, and etqw-data.
 Creating those packages requires data files from an "Enemy Territory:
 Quake Wars" installation or DVD.

Description: dedicated server for Enemy Territory: Quake Wars
 This package contains a launcher script and systemd unit to run a
 Enemy Territory: Quake Wars server using the proprietary
 x86 binaries provided by id Software.
 .
 Please note that the ETQW engine is not Free Software, and Debian
 cannot fix any bugs or security flaws in the engine or game code.
 .
 To mitigate any security flaws that might exist in this server,
 the systemd unit is not enabled by default, and must be enabled
 with systemctl if it should start at boot time. The systemd unit
 uses various security hardening options to prevent the server from
 escalating its privileges. There is no sysvinit script,
 since sysvinit does not provide similar security hardening.

Description: Launcher for proprietary games
 Various games are divided into two logical parts: engine
 and data. Often the engine and data are licensed in
 different ways, such that the engine can be distributed
 in Debian but the data cannot.
 .
 Some of the games supported by game-data-packager need to be
 started by a special launcher script that will create symbolic
 links or do other setup. This package contains those launcher
 scripts.
 .
 The following games currently require this package:
 .
  * Doom 2: The Master Levels

 5, Dimensions of the Past (developed by MachineGames to mark Quake's 20th
 anniversary), and for the official mission
