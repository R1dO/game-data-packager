Description: Installer for game data files
 Various games are divided into two logical parts: engine
 and data. Often the engine and data are licensed in
 different ways, such that the engine can be distributed
 in Debian but the data cannot.
 .
 game-data-packager is a tool which builds .deb files for game
 data which cannot be distributed in Debian (such as
 commercial game data).
 .

Description: Launcher for proprietary games
 Various games are divided into two logical parts: engine
 and data. Often the engine and data are licensed in
 different ways, such that the engine can be distributed
 in Debian but the data cannot.
 .
 Some of the games supported by game-data-packager need to be
 started by a special launcher script that will create symbolic
 links or do other setup. This package contains those launcher
 scripts.
 .
 The following games currently require this package:
 .
  * Doom 2: The Master Levels
  * Unreal
  * Unreal Gold
