Description: Quake III Data Files
 This package only provides the Quake III Engine (GPL) that is being
 improved by volunteers. In order to play, you need some (currently)
 non GPL data-files. Since they are non-free, they cannot be distributed
 by GNU/Debian.
 .
 You can choose to manually copy the data files into the
 right location or use the quake3-data package available from
 .
 http://scorpius.homelinux.org/~marc/debian/
 .
 This installer will give you the choice to play with the Demo files or
 install from a Quake III Arena CD.  In any case, you will need to
 install the point release in order to be able to play the game. Note
 that the shareware version does not allow you to play on full servers
 (or the other way around).
 .
 This package is not distributed in GNU/Debian because we are working on
 a better, more general and more flexible solution instead of limiting
 users to only Quake III Arena since this engine supports more Q3 based
 games and (total) conversions.
