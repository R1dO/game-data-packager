  * Add Multi-Arch: foreign fields to all Architecture: all packages.

    Jedi Outcast and its sequel Star Wars Jedi Knight: Jedi Academy,
    for use with the OpenJK engine. A fully patched installation using
    Windows or Wine is required: we do not know how to extract files
    from the patches.

    Castle Wolfenstein (English or French language). An installation
    using Windows or Wine is required, but it does not have to be fully

  * Avoid including a timestamp in generated packages' changelog.gz

  * Fix non-existent suggested package (Closes: #742383)
  * Add the ability for a game to produce and install more than one .deb
    at a time, and use it for Quake III Arena to produce quake3-data.deb
    and quake3-team-arena.deb simultaneously if it finds both (e.g. in
    an installation on Windows)

  [ Alexandre Detiste ]
