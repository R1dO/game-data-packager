quake (1) UNRELEASED; urgency=low

  [ David Banks ]
  * Initial release.

  [ Simon McVittie ]
  * Move to contrib/games due to dependency on non-distributable data
  * Allow game-data-packager to satisfy the quake-data dependency: if a
    user installs this package before data, we want g-d-p to get installed,
    and the launcher copes gracefully with being run with no data
  * Re-word package description to talk about quake-registered and
    quake-shareware specifically, since they're the core packages
  * Recommend something that can display the "need data" message
