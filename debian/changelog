  [ Simon McVittie ]
  * Add a confirmation step before running binary-only executables
  * etqw.desktop: add some more keywords
  * etqw*.6: document QUAKE4_BACKTRACE, QUAKE4_DEBUGGER
  * Remove unused (and not installed) quake4smp wrapper
  * Check scripts for missing substitutions
  * quake4.in: use the same source for ETQW
  * README.etqw-data: expand

quake (16) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Move Build-Depends-Indep to Build-Depends; they are needed
    for the quake4 package, which is Architecture: i386 due to
    its dependency on i386-only binaries.
  * Upload to unstable

 -- Simon McVittie <smcv@debian.org>  Sat, 21 Nov 2015 18:16:46 +0000

quake (15+exp1) experimental; urgency=medium

  * Enable the quake4 packages unconditionally
  * Upload to experimental to wait for NEW processing

quake (15) unstable; urgency=medium

  * quake3-server: correct help text
  * quake3-server: lock the Debian-quake3 account on purge, and unlock
    it on reinstallation, instead of deleting it on purge.
    This matches what we do for quake-server and quake2-server,
    and hardens the system against the possibility that files owned
    by Debian-quake3 might become owned by an unrelated user that
    is given the same numeric uid.
  * Add support for Quake 4, using the proprietary binaries (there is
    no open-source engine). These packages are currently skipped by
    default: use DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS=quake4 to build them.

 -- Simon McVittie <smcv@debian.org>  Sun, 01 Nov 2015 00:05:29 +0000

quake (14) unstable; urgency=medium

  [ Alexandre Detiste ]
  * Don't show "--text=" in kdialog prompt (Closes: #781943)
  * Suggest new packages quake2-{groundzero,reckoning}-data
    instead of their old names quake2-{groundzero,reckoning}

  [ Simon McVittie ]
  * Install a 48x48 version of the Quake III Arena icons in addition
    to 256x256, as recommended by the XDG Icon Theme spec
  * Stop installing traditional Debian menu files to comply with
    CTTE decision #741573
  * Stop installing XPM icons
  * Use unique temporary filenames, so parallel builds can work

 -- Simon McVittie <smcv@debian.org>  Fri, 02 Oct 2015 10:03:28 +0100

quake (13) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Canonicalize Vcs-Browser, and use https
  * Upload to unstable

 -- Simon McVittie <smcv@debian.org>  Wed, 29 Apr 2015 10:11:59 +0100

quake (12) experimental; urgency=low

  * quake3-server.init: set correct com_homepath for sysvinit servers
    (server.q3a, not /var/games/.../server.q3a - it is meant to be relative
    to $HOME)
  * quake3-server: install extra symlinks so that server.cfg can be found
    when using quake3*-data (>= 40)

 -- Simon McVittie <smcv@debian.org>  Thu, 05 Feb 2015 11:02:50 +0000

quake (11) experimental; urgency=low

  * quake3: fix installed-location detection by looking for pak0.pk3,
    not pak0.pak

 -- Simon McVittie <smcv@debian.org>  Wed, 04 Feb 2015 11:17:00 +0000

quake (10) experimental; urgency=low

  * quake2: execute debian_server.cfg again, reverting a change from v9.
    Unlike quake and quake3, quake2's default configuration file is named
    debian_server.cfg, and the demo and full game have different versions.
  * quake, quake3: remove support for START_DAEMON
    - if the server was previously disabled via START_DAEMON,
      do a one-time migration to "update-rc.d $SERVICE disable"
  * Modify quake*-server configuration
    - put default for DAEMON_OPTS in /etc/init.d/quake*-server so it can
      operate without /etc/default/quake*-server
    - "+exec etc/quake*-server/server.cfg" is no longer part of DAEMON_OPTS
    - add native systemd units
    - add optional instanced systemd units for multiple servers per machine
  * quake3: prefer to load game data from /usr/lib/quake3/base
    or /usr/lib/quake3/ta, where ioquake3 can provide native-code game modules
    - this requires ioquake3 (>= 1.36+u20150114+dfsg1-1~) and
      quake3*-data built by game-data-packager (>= 40)
  * quake3: experimental support for loading the demo data
    - the same requirements apply
  * Standards-Version 3.9.6 (no changes)
  * Simplify advice on obtaining game data, and point to
    game-data-packager's new declarative data files for checksums and
    exact sizes (Closes: #762823)
  * quake-server, quake2-server: if no data, exit 72 like quake3-server does

 -- Simon McVittie <smcv@debian.org>  Wed, 04 Feb 2015 10:18:27 +0000

quake (9) experimental; urgency=low

  * quake3.desktop: describe Q3 as an ActionGame, not an ArcadeGame
  * Install the Q3 icon to the freedesktop.org icon path
  * Add recoloured icons and desktop files for the Quake II mission packs
    (requires quake2-reckoning and/or quake2-groundzero from
    game-data-packager 39)
  * Add desktop file for Quake III: Team Arena (requires quake3-team-arena
    from game-data-packager 39) and install its icon
  * Partially sync server configuration from openjk and iortcw:
    - deprecate START_DAEMON
    - make /etc/quake*-server available as etc/quake*-server in the game
      engine's search path so it's more obvious what is being exec'd (leave
      the debian_server.cfg symlink in for compatibility)
  * quake3-server: use a non-hidden home path,
    /var/games/quake3-server/server.q3a, in preparation for multiple-instance
    support

 -- Simon McVittie <smcv@debian.org>  Thu, 22 Jan 2015 12:32:19 +0000

quake (8) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Avoid ambiguous precedence of Makefile rules for 24px icons,

 -- Simon McVittie <smcv@debian.org>  Tue, 10 Jun 2014 22:56:23 +0100

quake (7) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Fabian Greffrath ]
  * Sort Debian control files via "wrap-and-sort -ab".

  [ Simon McVittie ]
  * quake2-server: don't recommend x11-utils | etc., they are only used
    in the clients
  * Recommend kde-baseapps-bin instead of transitional kdebase-bin

 -- Simon McVittie <smcv@debian.org>  Sun, 09 Mar 2014 13:56:32 +0000

 -- Simon McVittie <smcv@debian.org>  Mon, 13 Jan 2014 11:03:16 +0000

quake3 (1.4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Add status action to init script
  * Don't refuse to start a new quake3-server if there's a stale pid file

    deleting the user itself

 -- Simon McVittie <smcv@debian.org>  Sat, 23 Jun 2012 14:08:41 +0100

quake3 (1.3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Make the desktop file definitely run /usr/games/quake3, and not some
    other quake3 on the user's $PATH
  * Upload to unstable/contrib now that I've done the same with g-d-p 25

quake3 (1.2) experimental; urgency=low

  * Make the QUAKE3_BACKTRACE option work properly

 -- Simon McVittie <smcv@debian.org>  Sun, 16 Jan 2011 22:27:07 +0000

quake3 (1.1) experimental; urgency=low

  * Allow game-data-packager to satisfy the quake3-data dependency
  * If quake3-data is missing from quake3, don't allow the game to run (the
    engine doesn't cope well with it); instead, use zenity, kdialog, xmessage
    or (as a last resort) terminal output to tell the user about
    game-data-packager
  * If quake3-data is missing from quake3-server, just output to the console
  * Add a simple init script (disabled by default, so you don't have to use
    it if you prefer to run the server under screen or something), based on
    the one in tremulous-server

 -- Simon McVittie <smcv@debian.org>  Fri, 12 Nov 2010 23:12:28 +0000

quake3 (1.0) experimental; urgency=low

  [ Jack Coulter ]
  * Initial packaging (Closes: #487933), based on work by Marc Leeman and
    Bruno Kleinert

  [ Simon McVittie ]
  * Adapt for the current version of ioquake3
  * Upgrade to source format 3.0 (native), debhelper v8, machine-readable
    copyright, and Policy version 3.9.1
  * Include the GIMP source file for the logo (from ioquake3), and produce
    lower-quality versions from it at build time
  * Upload to experimental for now, until a version of game-data-packager
    that can produce quake3-data reaches unstable

 -- Simon McVittie <smcv@debian.org>  Fri, 22 Oct 2010 23:29:21 +0100

quake (5) experimental; urgency=low

  * Team upload.
  * Fix quake2 dependency to be quake2-engine, not quake-engine.
    (Closes: #728506)

 -- Jonathan Dowland <jmtd@debian.org>  Mon, 11 Nov 2013 15:03:41 +0000

quake (4) experimental; urgency=low

  * Add support for Quake II
  * Upload to experimental

 -- Simon McVittie <smcv@debian.org>  Sun, 29 Sep 2013 14:51:56 +0100

quake (3) unstable; urgency=low

  [ David Banks ]
  * Add LSB description field to init script.

  [ David Banks ]
  * Suggest correct path to darkplaces

  [ Simon McVittie ]
  * Upload to unstable

 -- Simon McVittie <smcv@debian.org>  Wed, 09 Nov 2011 18:16:05 +0000

quake (1) experimental; urgency=low

  [ David Banks ]
  * Initial release.

  [ Simon McVittie ]
  * Move to contrib/games due to dependency on non-distributable data
  * Allow game-data-packager to satisfy the quake-data dependency: if a
    user installs this package before data, we want g-d-p to get installed,
    and the launcher copes gracefully with being run with no data
  * Change dependencies and re-word package description to talk about
    quake-registered and quake-shareware specifically, since they're the
    core packages
  * Recommend something that can display the "need data" message
  * Replace bitmapped icon with an independently-created SVG and scripts
    to generate various sizes
  * Add a Quake mini-policy in debian/policy.txt, describing a quake-engine
    alternative, and use that
  * Give the script a --engine switch to force a particular engine
  * Include menu entries for the mission packs, which are automatically
    hidden if the corresponding data files are not installed
  * Add a quake-server binary package
