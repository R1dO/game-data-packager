game-data-packager (45) UNRELEASED; urgency=medium

  * New game support:
    - Arthur: the Quest for Excalibur [skitt]
    - James Clavell's Shōgun [skitt]
    - Journey: Part One of the Golden Age Trilogy [skitt]
    - The Labyrinth of Time [adetiste]
    - Mixed-Up Fairy Tales [adetiste]
    - Mortville Manor [adetiste]
    - The Secret of Monkey Island 1 & 2 [adetiste]
    - Zork: The Undiscovered Underground [skitt]
    - Zork Zero [adetiste]
  * Support for new languages and versions:
    - Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade (English CD) [skitt]
    - Doom 1: Tech Gone Bad, brand new map by Romero [adetiste]
      (Closes: #812513)
    - Doom 1: Phobos Mission Control, another new map [fabian]
  * Enhancements and bug fixes:
    - Correct UnrealGoldPatch227i.7z's format [skitt]
    - The Unreal patches provide lin_convenience_libs [skitt]
    - Do not crash if there's no internet access and game
      is possibly owned by user's Steam account [adetiste]
    - Abort early when running from a deleted directory and --destination
      hasn't been specified [adetiste] (Closes: #783319)
  * Internal changes:
    - Refactor dependency relationships and other distro- and
      format-dependent values. They now take a map or list of
      maps like {'deb': 'foo-dfsg (>= 1)', 'generic': 'foo'}.
      Versioned dependencies are translated from dpkg syntax
      to RPM or Arch syntax as needed; and library dependencies
      can be spelled like "libfoo0.so.1" which will be translated
      to libfoo0-1 for dpkg distributions. [smcv]
    - Smarter handling of InnoExtract archives that takes alternative
      look_for names into account; which reduces the need
      to explicitly list files to unpack. [adetiste]
    - Build-Depends: on "pyflakes3 | pyflakes" to avoid to needlessly
      pull in Python2 during the build on Stretch and later. [adetiste]

  * Add configurable privilege-gaining method instead of always using su,
    defaulting to pkexec if available, or sudo if available and the user

  * hexen2-data Conflicts and Replaces hexen2-demo-data, hopefully this will
    give dpkg a hint that it is the better version
  * freespace2-data Conflicts and Replaces the versions built by scripts
    shipped with fs2-open
  * wolf3d-v*-data Conflicts and Replaces wolf3d-full-data

  [ Fabian Greffrath ]
  * Add Multi-Arch: foreign fields to all Architecture: all packages.
  * Prefer chocolate-doom over other engines providing doom-engine,
    heretic engine or hexen-engine, respectively. Add Breaks against
    versions of chocolate-doom not providing hertic-engine or hexen-engine.
  * Start heretic and hexen by calling the binaries of the same names in the
    respective desktop files.

  [ Simon McVittie ]
  * Add a prototype of data-driven packaging using Python 3 and YAML
  * Convert quake3-data to YAML style
  * quake3: add Team Arena patch files to quake3-data, and add support
    for generating quake3-team-arena-data
  * Add support for gathering PK3 files for Star Wars Jedi Knight II:
    Jedi Outcast and its sequel Star Wars Jedi Knight: Jedi Academy,
    for use with the OpenJK engine. A fully patched installation using
    Windows or Wine is required: we do not know how to extract files
    from the patches.
  * Add support for gathering PK3 and related files from Return to
    Castle Wolfenstein (English or French language). An installation
    using Windows or Wine is required, but it does not have to be fully
    patched.
  * Standards-Version: 3.9.6
  * Bump debhelper compat to 9 for better Python 3 handling
  * Avoid including a timestamp in generated packages' changelog.gz
  * Apply patches from Dwayne Litzenberger for a different
    edition of the Quake CD-ROM (Closes: #718688)
  * Fix non-existent suggested package (Closes: #742383)
  * Add the ability for a game to produce and install more than one .deb
    at a time, and use it for Quake III Arena to produce quake3-data.deb
    and quake3-team-arena.deb simultaneously if it finds both (e.g. in
    an installation on Windows)

  [ Alexandre Detiste ]
  * Add support for Tyrian, closes: #739486.

    either for quake-shareware or as a way to upgrade quake-registered
