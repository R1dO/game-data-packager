quake3 (1.1) experimental; urgency=low

  * Allow game-data-packager to satisfy the quake3-data dependency
  * If quake3-data is missing from quake3, don't allow the game to run (the
    engine doesn't cope well with it); instead, use zenity, kdialog, xmessage
    or (as a last resort) terminal output to tell the user about
    game-data-packager
  * If quake3-data is missing from quake3-server, just output to the console
  * Add a simple init script (disabled by default, so you don't have to use
    it if you prefer to run the server under screen or something), based on
    the one in tremulous-server

quake3 (1.0) experimental; urgency=low

  [ Jack Coulter ]

  * Adapt for the current version of ioquake3
  * Upgrade to source format 3.0 (native), debhelper v8, machine-readable
    copyright, and Policy version 3.9.1
  * Include the GIMP source file for the logo (from ioquake3), and produce
    lower-quality versions from it at build time
  * Upload to experimental for now, until a version of game-data-packager
    that can produce quake3-data reaches unstable

 -- Simon McVittie <smcv@debian.org>  Fri, 22 Oct 2010 23:29:21 +0100

quake (5) experimental; urgency=low

  * Team upload.
  * Fix quake2 dependency to be quake2-engine, not quake-engine.
    (Closes: #728506)

 -- Jonathan Dowland <jmtd@debian.org>  Mon, 11 Nov 2013 15:03:41 +0000

quake (1) experimental; urgency=low

  [ David Banks ]
  * Initial release.

  [ Simon McVittie ]
  * Move to contrib/games due to dependency on non-distributable data
  * Allow game-data-packager to satisfy the quake-data dependency: if a
    user installs this package before data, we want g-d-p to get installed,
    and the launcher copes gracefully with being run with no data
  * Change dependencies and re-word package description to talk about
    quake-registered and quake-shareware specifically, since they're the
    core packages
  * Recommend something that can display the "need data" message
  * Replace bitmapped icon with an independently-created SVG and scripts
    to generate various sizes
  * Add a Quake mini-policy in debian/policy.txt, describing a quake-engine
    alternative, and use that
  * Give the script a --engine switch to force a particular engine
  * Include menu entries for the mission packs, which are automatically
    hidden if the corresponding data files are not installed
  * Add a quake-server binary package
