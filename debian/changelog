quake3 (1.0) experimental; urgency=low

  [ Jack Coulter ]
  * Initial packaging (Closes: #487933), based on work by Marc Leeman and
    Bruno Kleinert

  [ Simon McVittie ]
  * Adapt for the current version of ioquake3
  * Upgrade to source format 3.0 (native), debhelper v8, machine-readable
    copyright, and Policy version 3.9.1
  * Include the GIMP source file for the logo (from ioquake3), and produce
    lower-quality versions from it at build time
  * Upload to experimental for now, until a version of game-data-packager
    that can produce quake3-data reaches unstable
