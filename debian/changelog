quake3 (1.1) UNRELEASED; urgency=low

  * Allow game-data-packager to satisfy the quake3-data dependency
  * If quake3-data is missing from quake3, don't allow the game to run (the
    engine doesn't cope well with it); instead, use zenity, kdialog, xmessage
    or (as a last resort) terminal output to tell the user about
    game-data-packager
  * If quake3-data is missing from quake3-server, just output to the console

quake3 (1.0) experimental; urgency=low

  [ Jack Coulter ]
  * Initial packaging (Closes: #487933), based on work by Marc Leeman and
    Bruno Kleinert

  [ Simon McVittie ]
  * Adapt for the current version of ioquake3
  * Upgrade to source format 3.0 (native), debhelper v8, machine-readable
    copyright, and Policy version 3.9.1
  * Include the GIMP source file for the logo (from ioquake3), and produce
    lower-quality versions from it at build time
  * Upload to experimental for now, until a version of game-data-packager
    that can produce quake3-data reaches unstable
