Quake3 is a 3D engine and can be used for a number of games, especially
now that people are porting in new models. A data installer should
reflect this. However, this is still work in progress. Until then,
you can use the quake3-data package from:

This will provide a nice automated way to install either the data from
the CD-Rom or the dhareware package.
