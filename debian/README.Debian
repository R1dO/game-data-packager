ioquake3 for Debian
===================

Icculus.Org Quake 3 is a 3D engine and can be used for a number of games, 
especially now that people are porting in new models.

To play id Software's proprietary Quake III Arena you must install and 
configure the package 'quake3-data'.

The quake3-data package provides a nice automated way to install either the 
Quake III Arena game data from the CD-ROM or the shareware game data from 
the internet.
