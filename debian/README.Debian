Quake 1 for Debian
==================

The Quake engine requires game data to run.  The data is not freely
redistributable.  You should use the 'game-data-packager' tool to install it.
'game-data-packager' supports many different versions of Quake.

If you just want to use data you already have unpacked on your disk, you can
copy the data to /usr/share/games/quake.
