Debian Quake mini-policy, version 1
===================================

Alternatives
------------

quake-engine is any Quake engine that, when run with -basedir DIR
and optionally -hipnotic or -rogue (where DIR contains at least id1/pak0.pak),
acts as a Quake client.

quake-engine-server is any Quake engine that, when run with the command-line
option -dedicated and the options above, acts as a Quake server. (By this
definition, almost every quake-engine could also be a quake-engine-server, but
engines where there is a separate server build with reduced dependencies
do not need to register their client as a potential server.)

Neither quake-engine nor quake-engine-server is really meant to be run
directly, so the alternatives go in /usr/lib/quake:

update-alternatives --quiet --install /usr/lib/quake/quake-engine \
    quake-engine /usr/bin/MYENGINE 0
update-alternatives --quiet --install /usr/lib/quake/quake-engine-server \
    quake-engine-server /usr/bin/MYSERVER 0

Quake engines do not generally share a dot-directory, so installing a "better"
engine would hide user configuration and save-games. Accordingly, every
implementation of the alternatives should register with priority 0, so that
the first engine that the user installs is considered "best" by
update-alternatives.

Virtual packages
----------------

Packages providing quake-engine must implement the quake-engine alternative.

Packages providing quake-engine-server must implement the quake-engine-server
alternative.

Non-Quake games
---------------

Games that use the Quake engine (like Nexuiz or OpenQuartz) should only depend
on quake-engine or quake-engine-server, or use the corresponding alternatives,
if they would run acceptably well on an unmodified id Quake engine with no
community patches or extra features (so no JPEG textures, for instance).

(For instance, Nexuiz relies on features from DarkPlaces, which is its
"official" engine, so it should depend on darkplaces directly and not rely
on quake-engine.)
