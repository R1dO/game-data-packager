Comment:
  This package contains launcher scripts, man pages, etc. originating
  in Debian, so there is no upstream project.
  .
  For Quake, Quake II and Quake III Arena, see the quakespasm, darkplaces,
  yquake2, ioquake3 packages for the actual game engines.
  .
  For Quake IV and Enemy Territory: Quake Wars, the proprietary engine
  binaries are included in the packages produced by game-data-packager.
