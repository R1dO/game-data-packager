Use game-data-packager to build and install the quake4-data
or quake4-de-data package.

The quake4-data package requires the commercial game files from any
non-German version of Quake 4, such as the English version available
on Steam.

The quake4-de-data package requires the commercial game files
from the German version of Quake 4, which is incompatible with
other versions.

Both packages depend on quake4-common-data and quake4-bin, which can
also be built using game-data-packager.
